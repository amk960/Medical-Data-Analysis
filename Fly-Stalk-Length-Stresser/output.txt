	Two Sample t-test

data:  fly_stressor1 and fly_stressor2
t = 7.866, df = 43, p-value = 7.345e-10
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.3749523 0.6335001
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 2.047143  1.542917 

>   #p-value is 0.00000000666 which is very small indicating that the results are statistically significant and there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  fly_stressor1 and fly_stressor2
W = 468.5, p-value = 8.857e-07
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

[1] "Variances of the two samples are equal. The samples are normally distributed"
> #In order to check these assumptions:
> hist(fly_stressor1, col = "purple")
> hist(fly_stressor2, col = "green")
> #The histograms are appproximately normally distributed with the fly_stressor2 having a peak at around 1.5 
> #the fly_stressor2 has a peak at around 2.0
> #the histogram shows visually that an approximate normal distribution exists with the a peak and then symmetry on both sides
> stripchart(fly_stressor1, col = "purple")
> stripchart(fly_stressor2, col = "green")
> #The stripcharts show that the spread of the values is approximately similar because the scatter looks similar.
> #this indicates that the two samples have an approximate equal variance
> #therefore the assumptions are met for this parametric test
